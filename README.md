I created a fun GroupMe bot that responds in one of these lines from "50 Cool Ways To Say No To Weed" (http://imgur.com/r/all/OtH2f92) randomly to any mention of 'weed', 'smoke', or 'roll up'

The code is based on the sample bot from the official tutorial (https://github.com/groupme/bot-tutorial-nodejs)
